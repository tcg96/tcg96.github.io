        <h1>No headphone jack on smartphones is inferior in every way.</h1>
        <hr/>
        <div class="text">
<p>The minority of smartphone users who still cares about the headphone jack finds this feature invaluable, no matter what year it is.
<br>Here are some facts and relatable anecdotes to explain the importance of this feature, from common suggestions to silly nitpicks.</p>
<p><strong><u>Note:</u></strong> in this page, &quot;headphone jack&quot; refers to a 3.5 mm audio out jack, and &quot;headphones&quot; also refers to earphones, earbuds, etc.</p>

<hr>
<p>Let's start with the obvious way to connect wired headphones when there's no headphone jack:</p>
<h2>🔌 Adapters</h2>

<h3>&quot;Get an adapter&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must always remember to carry said adapter. It adds an extra thought that was absent beforehand.</li>
<li>The adapter plugs into the only port in the phone, normally used for charging. This means <strong><u>you can't use wired headphones while charging</u></strong>, unless you get an enormous adapter with two ports, or you use wireless charging (not available on all phones) which is less efficient and you can't move your phone at all. How is that superior or more modern?</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Keep the adapter connected to your wired headphones&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>The headphone jack is not just for one pair of wired headphones.</u></strong> You could plug in different things at different times, like various pairs of headphones, speakers, stereo system... The adapter must be carried over.
<br>Even if you did buy one adapter for every single thing, sometimes you may want to plug in something that isn't yours (like someone else's stereo - ever heard of the &quot;pass the aux cord&quot; meme?). Maybe you have your headphones you can borrow the adapter from, but then we're back to the risk of losing the adapter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;How often do you use someone's stereo? They'll surely have their own adapter&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rarely, but it was just an example. No matter how unlikely or insignificant the situation is, or how small the inconvenience is, the lack of headphone jack ALWAYS adds an inconvenience.</li>
<!-- <li>They usually don't have their own adapter. I'm speaking from experience.</li> -->
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Would you be okay with a phone with two built-in USB-C ports, so you can charge and use the little adapter at the same time?&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't exist and it doesn't solve the other issues with an adapter.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>So adapters are worse: you can lose them and they interfere with the charging port.
<br>Well, how about the 🐘 in the room:</p>
<h2>🎧 Wireless Headphones</h2>

<h3><u></u> &quot;Get wireless headphones&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>A phone with headphone jack has Bluetooth as well</u></strong> - you can use wireless headphones there too.
<br>The problem is NOT wired vs. wireless. The problem is taking away one option. The headphone jack was <strong>removed</strong>, not replaced with a newer alternative.</li>
<!-- <li>All the money you spend on wired headphones goes into their sound quality. For wireless headphones, you also have to pay for their extra technology, so they're more expensive or they have worse sound quality.</li> -->
<li>I already have good wireless headphones. They can't replace my good wired headphones.</li>
<li>Wireless headphones have batteries that can run out and they can't be used while charging.</li>
<li>Don't forget other audio stuff you can use the headphone jack with.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Charge wireless headphones in advance&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>They WILL be discharged when you don't expect it.</li>
<li>What about in two or three years when they can no longer hold a charge? Their batteries are designed not to be replaced. You have to throw away perfectly good audio equipment just because its batteries are dead!</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;The case of wireless headphones keeps the headphones themselves charged&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's just another battery. Does it last forever?</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Carry a powerbank to charge the headphones case&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yet another battery. Do wireless headphones charge as quickly as the act of plugging in wired headphones?</li>
<!-- <li>I'm one of the people that bought one before the term &quot;powerbank&quot; existed: I paid &euro;70 for a 7000 mAh Sony CycleEnergy portable charger in 2013. I still have it, it still has enough juice for charging a phone once. But I don't carry it all the time. Now I have to, just for some headphones?</li> -->
</ul>

<h3>&quot;When you see the case of wireless headphones is discharged, you know you've only got the charge of the headphones themselves&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't guarantee the headphones are charged enough.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;You really have to charge in advance. Better be safe than sorry&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>So you can't live without thinking about the battery level of wireless headphones?</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;You do live thinking about the battery level of your phone though&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>That's only one thing. Why add another?</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Just charge wireless headphones for like 10 minutes, then they'll last for like an hour&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>No they won't. Even if they did, how is that better than just using wired headphones instantly for as long as you want? Maybe you needed to listen to something for those 10 minutes only.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Turns out wireless headphones aren't perfect and don't replace everything that can go in a headphone jack.
<br>But hey, the headphone jack <em>had</em> to go away! Its disappearance did more good than harm. Or did it?</p>
<h2>❎ Justifying Its Removal</h2>

<h3>&quot;Removing the headphone jack makes the phone more water resistant&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are phones with headphone jack and water resistance, such as the Galaxy S7 to S10. Even the iPhone 6S has an early attempt at water resistance despite no IP rating.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;It is harder to make a water resistant phone with headphone jack&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many other aspects about manufacturing a phone are much harder.</li>
<li>Why does it have to be water resistant? Plenty of &quot;water resistant&quot; phones get water damaged anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Removing the headphone jack makes the phone thinner&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>The headphone jack is 3.5&nbsp;millimetres in diameter. Add 2-mm padding and that's 7.5&nbsp;mm. Any new smartphone is thicker than that.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;The headphone jack doesn't fit with other components&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nonsense. It fits on the Unihertz Jelly Star which has a 3.0-inch screen, but not on the Jelly Max which is 5.0&nbsp;inches and 17&nbsp;mm thick? (That phone was one of the last straws that made me write this page.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Removing the headphone jack allows for a bigger battery&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>The headphone jack is a tiny rectangle. The space you gain by removing it can't be occupied by extra battery, which is only one or two big rectangles.
<br>Even if you redesign the internals to be a different shape so the battery can be a little bit taller or wider, how is that easier than making the battery deeper instead?
<br>I'm no engineer, but I think it would be better if new smartphones were just ONE MILLIMETRE thicker. It would significantly increase the volume and capacity of a battery that would fit, no&nbsp;one would complain about the thickness, and it would eliminate the camera bump as the cherry on top. Unihertz did that with the Jelly Max (it's almost twice as thick as other current smartphones), but they omitted that jack!</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;The DAC in built-in headphone jacks is bad&quot;</h3>
<ul>
(DAC = Digital to Analogue Converter, i.e. the part that generates the sound waves that go into the audio cable)
<li>No, it's good enough. The one in the adapters or Bluetooth audio devices isn't better.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;The Apple iPhone removed the headphone jack to make room for the 'Taptic Engine&reg;&trade;'&quot;</h3>
<ul>
(&quot;Taptic Engine&reg;&trade;&quot; = Apple's improved vibration motor)
<li>The iPhone 6S has headphone jack and &quot;Taptic Engine&reg;&trade;&quot;. On the iPhone 7 (first model without that jack) the &quot;Taptic Engine&reg;&trade;&quot; inside was enlarged to make up for the empty space, not because it was necessary. It does have additional vibration feedback compared to the 6S, but that's just a software feature. The two revisions of that vibration motor feel the same. In newer iPhones, the &quot;Taptic Engine&reg;&trade;&quot; is about the same size as in the 6S, and the phones themselves are much larger. There could be room.</li>
<li>If it was just an Apple issue, this page wouldn't exist.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Pretty much everyone has removed the headphone jack from their newer phones, to sell their wireless headphones&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>And shame on them for trying to copy the status symbol. The only reason to go for an Android phone is that it's better than an iPhone. But without that jack, new iPhones and new Android phones are equally as bad!</li>
<!-- <li>People will always buy Apple products no matter how shitty they are. But it's not just Apple that removed that jack and then started making their own wireless headphones. Who buys Samsung or Google or Lenovorola or Huawei or Xiaomi headphones, when they cost nearly the same as the Apple ones? No&nbsp;one. Anyone who wants expensive wireless headphones buys the Apple ones, even if they don't have other Apple products, because they work over standard Bluetooth.</li> -->
<li>Wireless headphones are fashion accessories. Even the Apple ones work over standard Bluetooth, so people buy those even if they don't have other Apple products. Even if the headphone jack had never been removed, wireless headphones would have still sold like hotcakes. There's really no need to talk about them when discussing the headphone jack, but they keep being suggested as if they replaced everything that can go into that jack...</li>
<!-- <li>My current phone is a few years old but still works fine. It has good battery life for one day and does everything I need. As long as WhatsApp works on it, it's not obsolete. It <em>will</em> become obsolete eventually, but not anytime soon (it's 2024 now). At that point I'll have to switch to a newer phone that is probably going to be huge (that's my other gripe with smartphones, I don't want a phablet), but a big phone with that jack is better than any phone without. I should be able to find it, but who knows?</li> -->
</ul>


<hr>
<p>Indeed, the removal of this feature literally benefitted no&nbsp;one.
<br>But surely you could move on from it, couldn't you?</p>
<h2>🏝 A Different Lifestyle</h2>

<h3>&quot;Just try a phone without a headphone jack. You'll get used to it&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're supposed to get out of your comfort zone only for things that are eventually worth it. Even if you got used to no headphone jack, your life wouldn't improve any.</li>
<li>I owned a phone without headphone jack for nearly three years. I couldn't get used to it at all. It was a high-end, beautiful and powerful phone. No complaints about it besides the lack of this feature. I always had to work around it, despite owning adapters and wireless headphones too. It was always a mild inconvenience. I couldn't be happier since switching back to a phone with that jack four years ago, while still using bluetooth audio sometimes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Carry a separate device for music, like an MP3 player&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't want a smartphone!
<br>The whole point of a smartphone is to have one device that serves multiple purposes on the go. Remember the tagline of the first iPhone in 2007? A phone, an iPod, and an Internet communication device all in one. <a href="http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=iphone" target="_blank">Despite other smartphones at the time already being superior</a>, the iPhone combined these features well enough to become successful. And now they have to be separate again? Wow, so modern! /s
<!-- <br>Once again, wireless headphones don't replace everything that goes in the headphone jack. Even the first iPhone had both options. In fact the first iPhone's bluetooth was compatible with nothing but audio devices, even though sending files via bluetooth was extremely popular back then (basically the ancestor to AirDrop/Nearby&nbsp;Share/Quick&nbsp;Share). --></li>
<li>The headphone jack is not just for listening to music.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;There are still new smartphones with a headphone jack. It hasn't gone extinct like 8-track cartridges or floppy disks&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>The choices are extremely limited. Ironically, in recent years that jack is more commonly found on lower-end phones. It's such a shame that so many otherwise perfect phones can't be considered, for example the iPhone 12 Mini or the Jelly Max. No matter how many bells and whistles you add, nothing can make up for it.</li>
<li>The 3.5-mm audio plug isn't going extinct because, again, it hasn't been supplanted by something more modern.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Wired headphones get tangled up and fall off&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, that can be annoying. But I think this one disadvantage is much easier to deal with than all the disadvantages of wireless headphones.</li>
<li>Even wireless headphones can fall off your ears, and it's harder to retrieve them because there's no wire. They're more likely to fall to the ground. Shoving ground germs in your ears, very healthy. Or even better, they could fall into places where you can't get them back! I'm sure Mother Nature is loving all that plastic and lithium being sprinkled around the globe.</li>
<li>You charge wireless headphones with a cable. Or by placing them on a wireless charger (which also has a cable) where you look at them wrong and they stop charging. Another modern solution /s</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Get wired headphones with Lightning or USB-C plug. No need for an adapter&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<!-- <li>What about all the other things that are only available with 3.5-mm plug? You have to throw away perfectly good audio equipment? Another W for the environment /s</li> -->
<li>What if your preferred model of headphones or piece of audio equipment is only available with a 3.5-mm plug? Or if you want to use your headphones with something other than your phone?</li>
<li>It still occupies the charging port.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;No&nbsp;one uses wired audio stuff anymore&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I know I am no&nbsp;one. The irony is that when the iPhone 7 was new, most people complained about the removal of that jack just because they needed it for the aux input in their car stereo. Now those people bought a bluetooth receiver. But even back then, I was already driving a car with bluetooth included. That's not where I need that jack.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Get a bluetooth receiver for your wired headphones&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>That's just a wireless adapter. In a car stereo without bluetooth, or wherever you have a stereo system, it's fine because it's always in the same place. Not so much anywhere else.
<br>All the disadvantages of adapters PLUS the disadvantages of wireless PLUS the one disadvantage of wired? Sign me up please! /s</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;You're justifying keeping an old/cheap phone. If you were given the newest most expensive Apple iPhone Max or Samsung Galaxy Ultra for free, no strings attached, you'd take it&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>No I wouldn't. It's not everyone's cup of tea. Everyone also dreams of sports cars and jewellery and tropical islands, right?
<!-- <br>I borrowed some new giant phones (not just tried them at a store) so I know what they're like. I can afford one but I don't want it, even if it had a headphone jack. This is just me, but I'm not a teen anymore. I'm no longer fascinated by the newest electronics. --></li>
<!-- <li>My current phone is not old. It can do all the modern-day mainstream smartphone tasks. It has a 64-bit CPU, 4G, VoLTE, NFC, 4K video recording, 128 GB of internal storage, fingerprint reader, and still gets app updates and OS security updates. An actually old phone would have none of these benefits.</li> -->
<li>What's wrong with not wanting to create more e-waste? It doesn't matter how old an object is if it works properly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;You're overthinking it. Use wireless headphones, and when they're discharged at an inopportune time you can use wired ones with an adapter&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to use wired ones more often than that. Is that so weird?</li>
<li>Is always having to carry an extra pair of headphones more modern than just carrying one pair that works anytime?</li>
<li>Don't forget the headphone jack isn't just for one pair of headphones.</li>
<li>What if your phone and your headphones are discharged at the same time and you don't have the huge adapter with two jacks?</li>
<li>The adapter would have been okay if there was a valid reason for that jack to be removed. I'm not making my life slightly less convenient for this.
<!-- <br>I also dislike that new laptops removed the optical drive, because I still use CDs and DVDs often. But because a laptop is larger and less mobile than a phone, a USB optical drive is acceptable.
<br>The &quot;replacements&quot; for a headphone jack (adapter or wireless headphones) are unacceptable workarounds. --></li>
<li>This is the be-all and end-all page to answer all concerns about this topic. It took years of examining all possible situations to come up with everything that's written here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&quot;Okay, no headphone jack is bad, but you'll survive without headphones once in a while. Stop complaining&quot;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Just because it doesn't kill you, doesn't mean it should be accepted. Stop trying to convince anyone to accept an inferior experience.
<br>You think having two cameras on a phone instead of three is a deal breaker, I think having no headphone jack is.</li>
<li>I don't use the headphone jack a lot. But I don't tolerate the inability to use that jack in situations where it WOULD be possible if it were built-in, no matter how unlikely they are.</li>
<li>The removal of the headphone jack popularised people blasting sounds in public.</li>
</ul>
